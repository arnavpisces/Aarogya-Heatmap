The vision of our project is - "minimizing the casualties". Basically the USP of our project is to create a heatmap of areas where there is an outbreak of a particular disease. This would help the government to roll out the prevention methods much more fast than the earlier lazy process they use. This would also help people to know about what precautions to take when going to a place with an outbreak (for work and such). We have used and modified the HyperTrack API to generate heatmaps of the areas of outbreak.
The second purpose of our app is : Easy access with a professional doctor for treatment to some extent. Very helpful in remote areas where there is a huge lack of good doctors. We have used firebase and created a whole new app for this chat service between the doctor and the patient.
Moreover we have created website using html,css and d3.js to showcase our project.
